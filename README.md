# Making a website more accessible

# Description
The purpose of this project was to refactor an exsisting website making it more accessible and emploring current HTML best practices. This involved adding 'alt' tags to all of the images, fixing a link issue, and conslidating the css document. Each element was controlled separately instead of the code just being repeated.
